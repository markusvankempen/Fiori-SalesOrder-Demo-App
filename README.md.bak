SAPUI5-Fiori
============

SAP Fiori-like app in SAPUI5. 

Introduction
------------
The app in this repo is based on the final example application from SAPTechEd CD168 hands-on session "Building SAP Fiori-like UIs with SAPUI5". 


More Information
----------------
To find out more about this CD168 session have a look at this blog post [Building SAP Fiori-like UIs with SAPUI5](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2013/10/06/building-sap-fiori-like-uis-with-sapui5). 

You can also see a screencast of this app in action here: [SAPUI5/Fiori - Exploration of an App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOO4szA2Bg); this screencast is part of a larger 2-part SAP CodeTalk session on SAPUI5 and Fiori with me and Ian Thain, which you can watch here: [SAP CodeTalk - SAPUI5 and Fiori](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQd9kVApjkE&list=PLfctWmgNyOIcae85Ytr6b_J1jgcDb4-JL).

SAPUI5 and OpenUI5
------------------
[SAPUI5](scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end) is the HTML5 UI framework from SAP. [OpenUI5](http://sap.github.io/openui5/) (here on Github) is the open source version. 

Details
-------
The app uses a Component based MVC approach.

On top of the original sources, I have added experimental comparisons between different view sources, in different branches of this repo:

- [XML](https://github.com/qmacro/SAPUI5-Fiori/tree/master)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/qmacro/SAPUI5-Fiori/tree/js)
- [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/qmacro/SAPUI5-Fiori/tree/coffee)

plus CoffeeScript sources for other JavaScript files (such as controllers).

Disclaimer
----------
The app sources from the CD168 course, upon which this app instance is based, worked perfectly. Any issues with this particular instance are my fault :-)
